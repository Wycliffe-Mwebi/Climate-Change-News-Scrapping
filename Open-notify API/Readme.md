# Open-notify API
## How Many people are in Space Now
The International Space Station (ISS) is a multi-nation construction project that is the largest single structure humans ever put into space. Its main construction was completed between 1998 and 2011, although the station continually evolves to include new missions and experiments. It has been continuously occupied since Nov. 2, 2000.

In this project we want to know who is currently inside the space station by using Nasa's Open-notify API, which gives access to data about the international space station.
